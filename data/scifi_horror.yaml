  description: Not to be confused with "Murder By Television" starring Bela Lugosi.
    This film is about a young inventor trying to get his television system financed.
    A gang of crooks are out to stop him. This film is considered science fiction
    by many because the concept of television was still on the drawing boards in the
    30's, but it's also a comedy. Stars Lyle Talbot, Mary Astor, Nat Pendleton, and
    Joyce Compton. Whether you would consider this scifi or not, you should find it
    entertaining anyway.

    \ is an obsessive opponent of all things nuclear. Fearing that atomic weapons\
    \ will destroy all life on earth, he recruits a group of scientists for his Society\
    \ to Save Civilization, and they make plans to find a living space deep within\
    \ the earth where man can survive and rebuild from the nuclear holocaust they\
    \ see just over the horizon. After the group fails to secure any funding, a rich\
    \ newspaper publisher's son forks over the cash and accompanies them on their\
    \ monumental journey.\nThey design a cyclotram, basically a great big ugly metal\
    \ boxcar with a humongous drill for a nose, ascend to the top of an extinct volcano,\
    \ go down into the crater and start drilling through rock as they make their way\
    \ downward. \nEvery so often, they stop for a minute to fight or to provide an\
    \ opportunity for one of them to die."
