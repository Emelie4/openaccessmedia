  description: Made on an ultra-low budget of $200, Dingoman Productions proudly presents
    their first feature film, The Legend of Action Man, a comedy about a mediocre,
    self-proclaimed superhero Action Man (James McEnelly) who is warned that if he
    causes any more trouble around town he'll be put under house arrest. In comes
    Mark (Trey Dixon), a fresh-faced news intern looking for a big story to get his
    work on TV, and Action Man seems like an interesting subject. That is, until a
    murder is reported and the new duo suspects John Magnum (Chris Newhouse), a suspicious
    millionaire who just moved in down the block. Can Action Man save the city of
    Sugar Land from his first real villain, or is he in over his head?
